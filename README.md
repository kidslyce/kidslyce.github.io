Looking for data in a Galaxy Far Far Away...

Using Ajax I was able to call the Star Wars API and create a user interface for navigating the planetary systems of the Star Wars Galaxy

I was able to keep my code dry by using Template literals to invoke functions and print the data from the api onto modals with the corrolating planets.

So many unsolved problems ... In theory I wanted so much more... in an effort to start small and expand being held up by my constraints in javascript 
I wasnt able to implement all of the functionailty.

I wanted to be able to scroll through all of the planets in the star wars database and have hover functionaliy of the modals when crossing the cursor.
It wasnt until after that I realized that the UX/UI aspect of my progect was flawed and I need much more DOM intergration to really unlock the power of this.
