Have you ever wanted to know more about the planets in a galaxy far, far away?

look no further, a galaxy far far away is here...

So using ajax Im able to pull data from the Star Wars API.

Using Template literals I was able to refactor my code and pass through the data pulled from 
the API to create modals and append the desired attributes inside them.

So much wrong with this site and functionailty... I need a scroll funciton to allow the user 
an experience that isnt so hard coded. As I started "small" and wanted to work my way up from there. I was unable to add the concepts of design that I really wanted to implement...

My constraints as a JS coder have become very apparent and the great thing abiut this is that I have no wehre but up to go from here!!!
